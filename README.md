# USInfluenzaSeasonTableau

The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The goal is to determine when to send staff, and how many, to all 50 states for the upcoming influenza season.
